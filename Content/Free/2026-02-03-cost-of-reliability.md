# Prompt
When did you realize that being “the reliable one” had quietly become an expectation rather than a gift?

## Context
Becoming a source of reliability and consistent stability is not always immediately apparent. 

Humans make conscious and subsconscious decisions every day, and many of those end up involving other people. 
Sometimes intentional, other times intrinsic. Regardless, it is always deliberate. 

Nobody likes to deal with an ongoing problem, so the fastest and easiest solution will always be favorable, even if that solution is you. 

## Action Taken
Assuming the place of the "reliable one" in people's lives often means being their grounding for technical, analytical, philosophical, or even emotional grounding. 

Carrying myself as the person of authority or reason in many situations has become a lived expectation of myself, not just a guideline for treating others. 

Handling matters no longer becomes a chance at personal accomplishment and pride; it sits in the line between thought and reality. 

## Internal State
A blessing and a curse, both tearing at the subconscious from opposite directions. 

The mind wants to set boundaries for constant activity while the heart wants to aid every chance that it sees fit. The soul feels the pull to give wherever can be given, while the will wishes for moment of resprite. 

## Outcome
Consistency and persistence. 

Despite the ebb and flow of demands and wishes, to be in a position to offer aid is a gift. To be the one to provide that gift is an honor.  

## Reflection
It would be a tragedy if no help was worth giving anymore. 

Aid, charity, and generosity are an integral part of the human experience, even if it gets tangled in the mess of free will.
