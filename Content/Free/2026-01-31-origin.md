# Prompt
What does “Helping the Help” mean, and why does it exist?

## Context
“Helping the Help” is an act of service or kindness intended for anyone in a position of service, built from kindness.

In a transactional society, helping the help is meant to aid the people and processes that keep the society running.

The goal of “Helping the Help” is to provide perspective, understanding, and awareness of the processes that formalize genuine “help.”

## Action Taken
I have created “Helping the Help” as a platform to host these documents and reflections.

I have committed myself to sharing my knowledge, insight, and hardships as a person committed to giving and transforming, never extracting.

## Internal State
Fear, excitement, clarity.

To give help is to fully assume the context and character of the help, and proceed to adopt it.

However frightening that feeling may be, it is equally met with excitement to contribute to a long-forgotten social currency; wisdom.

## Outcome
The website is live.

The thoughts, recollections, and concerns that come from sharing internalized structures and patterns are now bubbling in the “soup” of my brain.

## Reflection
As I progressed through the development and publication of “Helping the Help,” I came to realize a part of me that I always tried suppressing.

Helping others should always be seen as a gift, even if it feels like a burden.

“Helping the Help” is my way of helping others to continue to help, even if it feels like a burden.
