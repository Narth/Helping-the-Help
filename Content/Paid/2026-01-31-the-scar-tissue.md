# Prompt
Describe a time “helping” became self-erasure, and describe a boundary you wish existed.

## Context
My entire professional career has been in service and support.

On payroll, that has been via technical consulting, break-fix support, customer service, and specialized technician positions.

Off payroll, my skills and knowledge have been tested via community engagement, freelance electronics repair, and 24/7 on-call support.

## Action Taken
I had successfully internalized the idea that service and support were where value lied, not within the provider or supporter.

Over the years, I had convinced myself that my value was in the help being given, and never with the helper.

## Internal State
I lost the ability to take pride in the work and service I give.

What once gave a deep sense of accomplishment on completion now served as fire to keep pushing.

I long for a sense of satisfaction but am continually met with a sense of duty.

## Outcome
“Help” and “helping” are measured by the impact seen via any process, not solely by an internal measurement of self-worth.

## Reflection
After years of giving my all to others, I am now fueled by a desire to see and push the limits of my aid.

After years of denying the value of myself and my contributions, I am on a quest to decide for myself what "valuable" means.
