# Prompt
Describe a moment where you helped without being asked, and only later realized the help mattered.

## Context
Offering service to someone is like opening Pandora's Box; you may understand the action you are taking, but you may never truly know how deep it will go. 

In my career, I have seen issues that showed themselves in bright colors. 

I have seen major problems that hide in the dark, waiting for someone to poke them with a stick. 

Other times, I have been absolutely clueless on where to even begin, and where the complications may lie. 

## Action Taken
In many parts of the service and repair world, solving problems very rarely means attacking the issues that seem obvious. 

In people management and social settings, helping most often appears as a one way street. 

Most of the time, helping can be as simple as just showing up to address an issue, as one cannot assume that others will accept the risk. 

## Internal State
Unsolicited aid can be a very tricky concept. To offer and help without consent is to assume responsibility for the help being given and "asked". 

Regardless, people are very simple creatures. What upsets, bothers, disrupts, or inconveniences does not have to always be expressed to be known. 

Listen to people. Look at them while they are sharing or discussing. A person's body speaks stories a mouth could never imagine. 

## Outcome
Always help where possible, but maintain discipline and consent when extending "help" to anyone that may be wanting it. 

## Reflection
Giving aid, even when not called for, often may appear self-gratifying but has profound effects on those impacted. In both good and bad ways.
